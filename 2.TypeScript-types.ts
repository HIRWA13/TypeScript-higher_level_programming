// 1. Type annotation and Type inference:
// type annotation in typescript is a process of giving variables their respective types by using annotation tags.(it's done by developers)
// type inference is when typescript assumes the type of a variable due to different reasons:
// -> first, when we declare a variable and we didi not annotate the type of that variable, typescript will assume the type depending on the value that variable is holding.
// -> in case tha that variable is not initialized, typescript will guess that type to be of type [any]
